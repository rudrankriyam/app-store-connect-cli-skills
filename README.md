## Available Skills

### asc-cli-usage

Guidance for running `asc` commands (flags, pagination, output, auth).

**Use when:**
- You need the correct `asc` command or flag combination
- You want JSON-first output and pagination tips for automation

**Example:**

```bash
Find the right asc command to list all builds for app 123456789 as JSON and paginate through everything.
```

### asc-workflow

Define and run repo-local automation graphs using `asc workflow` and `.asc/workflow.json`.

**Use when:**
- You are migrating from lane-based automation to repo-local workflows
- You need multi-step orchestration with machine-parseable JSON output for CI/agents
- You need hooks (`before_all`, `after_all`, `error`), conditionals (`if`), and private helper sub-workflows
- You want validation (`asc workflow validate`) with cycle/reference checks before execution

**Example:**

```bash
Create an asc workflow that stages a release, validates it, and only submits when CONFIRM_RELEASE=true.
```

### asc-app-create-ui

Create a new App Store Connect app via browser automation when no API exists.

**Use when:**
- You need to create an app record (name, bundle ID, SKU, primary language)
- You are comfortable logging in to App Store Connect in a real browser

**Example:**

```bash
Create a new App Store Connect app for com.example.myapp with SKU MYAPP123 and primary language English (U.S.).
```

**Example:**

```bash
Archive and export my macOS app as a PKG I can upload to App Store Connect.
```

### asc-shots-pipeline

Agent-first screenshot pipeline using xcodebuild/simctl, AXe, JSON plans, `asc screenshots frame` (experimental), and `asc screenshots upload`.

**Use when:**
- You need a repeatable simulator screenshot automation flow
- You want AXe-based UI driving before capture
- You need a staged pipeline (capture -> frame -> upload)

End-to-end release workflows for TestFlight and App Store.

**Use when:**
- You want to upload, distribute, and submit in one flow
- You need the manual sequence for fine-grained control
- You're releasing for iOS, macOS, visionOS, or tvOS

**Example:**

```bash
Publish version 2.4.0 of my iOS app to TestFlight for the Beta Testers group and wait for processing.
```

### asc-signing-setup

Bundle IDs, capabilities, certificates, and provisioning profiles.

**Use when:**
- You are onboarding a new app or bundle ID
- You need to create or rotate signing assets

**Example:**

```bash
Set up signing for com.example.app with iCloud enabled, a distribution certificate, and an App Store profile.
```

### asc-id-resolver

Resolve IDs for apps, builds, versions, groups, and testers.

**Use when:**
- A command requires IDs and you only have names
- You want deterministic outputs for automation

**Example:**

```bash
Resolve the App Store Connect app ID, latest build ID, and TestFlight group IDs for MyApp.
```

### asc-metadata-sync

Metadata and localization sync (including legacy metadata format migration).

**Use when:**
- You are updating App Store metadata or localizations
- You need to validate character limits before upload
- You need to update privacy policy URL or app-level metadata

**Example:**

```bash
Pull my App Store metadata into ./metadata, update the privacy policy URL, and push the changes back safely.
```

### asc-localize-metadata

Translate App Store metadata (description, keywords, what's new, subtitle) to multiple locales using LLM translation prompts and push via `asc`.

**Use when:**
- You want to localize an app's App Store listing from a source locale (usually en-US)
- You need locale-aware keywords (not literal translations) and strict character limit enforcement
- You want a review-before-upload workflow for translations

**Example:**

```bash
Translate my en-US App Store metadata into German, French, and Japanese, then show me the changes before upload.
```

### asc-aso-audit

Run an offline ASO audit on canonical App Store metadata under `./metadata` and surface keyword gaps using Astro MCP.

**Use when:**
- You want to audit subtitle, keywords, description, and what's new fields for waste and formatting issues
- You want keyword-gap analysis against Astro-tracked rankings and competitor terms
- You want follow-up actions that map cleanly to `asc metadata keywords ...`

**Example:**

```bash
Audit ./metadata for ASO problems, then show the highest-value keyword gaps from Astro for my latest version.
```

### asc-whats-new-writer

Generate engaging, localized App Store release notes from git log, bullet points, or free text using canonical metadata under `./metadata`.

**Use when:**
- You want polished What's New copy from rough release inputs
- You want localized release notes across existing locales
- You want a review-before-upload workflow using `asc metadata push` or direct metadata edits

**Example:**

```bash
Turn these release bullet points into polished What's New notes for en-US and localize them across my existing metadata locales.
```

### asc-submission-health

Preflight checks, submission, and review monitoring.

**Use when:**
- You want to reduce submission failures
- You need to track review status and re-submit safely
- You're troubleshooting "version not in valid state" errors

**Example:**

```bash
Preflight my iOS submission, check encryption/content-rights issues, and tell me what will block review.
```

### asc-testflight-orchestration

Beta groups, testers, build distribution, and What to Test notes.

**Use when:**
- You manage multiple TestFlight groups and testers
- You need consistent beta rollout steps

**Example:**

```bash
Export my current TestFlight config, create a new external group, add testers, and attach the latest build.
```

### asc-build-lifecycle

Build processing, latest build resolution, and cleanup.

**Use when:**
- You are waiting on build processing
- You want automated cleanup and retention policies

**Example:**

```bash
Find the latest processed build for app 123456789 and preview expiring all TestFlight builds older than 90 days.
```

### asc-ppp-pricing

Territory-specific pricing using purchasing power parity (PPP).

**Use when:**

```

### asc-revenuecat-catalog-sync

Reconcile App Store Connect subscriptions/IAP with RevenueCat products, entitlements, offerings, and packages.

**Use when:**
- You want to sync ASC product catalogs to RevenueCat
- You need to create missing ASC subscriptions/IAPs before mapping them
- You want an audit-first workflow with explicit apply confirmation

**Example:**

```bash
Audit my App Store Connect subscriptions and IAPs against RevenueCat, then create any missing mappings after I approve the plan.
```

### asc-notarization

Archive, export, and notarize macOS apps with Developer ID signing.

**Use when:**
- You need to notarize a macOS app for distribution outside the App Store
- You want the full flow: archive → Developer ID export → zip → notarize → staple
- You're troubleshooting Developer ID signing or trust chain issues

**Example:**

```bash
Archive my macOS app, export it for Developer ID, notarize the ZIP, and staple the result.
```
